# Dropbox stencil examples

This repository contains examples for how to store and serialize data
in the dataserver and keyserver.  For more information, see the
comments in each file. 

## Relevant files

All examples/changes from the stencil are contained in two files:

 - `test_examples.py`:  Read the tests in each file for examples on
   how to store various types of objects in the dataserver and
   examples on testing
   
 - `client.py`: Contains a *really insecure* implementation of part of
   the Dropbox client to support the attack test examples in
   `test_examples.py`
