## test_examples.py - Examples for using stencil components and testing
## This file contains examples of how to use the Dataserver and

## want to use in this project.

## As you think about building your implementation, skim over these
## examples for some ideas on how to represent you data.

## **Examples for testing attacks**

        c.create_user("a", "1234")
        user = c.authenticate_user("a", "1234")


        #### Attack phase:  act like adversary and do things client shouldn't_bytes

        # As the attacker, we can directly use methods provide by the
        # dataserver and keyserver, which mimics the attacker's
        # capabilities of being able to add/modify data
        # See "Threat model" section on Wiki for more info.

        # Let's try to change alice's password
        # Relies on us knowing something about how data is stored
        dataserver.Set(s_addr("a"), "oops".encode("utf-8"))

        #### Testing:  try to do some action as client or adversary to prove attack worked
        user2 = c.authenticate_user("a", "oops")

        # When you write your attack tests, you should instead
        # probably test to make sure the attack is NOT successful:
        # self.assertRaises(util.DropboxError, c.authenticate_user, "a", "oops")

        # Example 2:  Try to log in as if you were user (and it should fail)
        self.assertRaises(util.DropboxError, c.authenticate_user, "a", "1234")

    # What if we didn't know where the password was stored?  Or, what
    # if we wanted to change a lot of data?
    def test_bad_file_upload(self):
        ###### Setup Phase
        user = c.create_user("a", "1234")
        file_bytes = b"hello world!"
        user.upload_file("file", file_bytes)

        #### Attack phase

        # FOR TESTING/ATTACKS ONLY: The Keyserver and Dataserver have
        # a method GetMap() which iterates over all its contents
        for memloc, data in dataserver.GetMap().items():
            # Overwrite whatever's here with some zeroes (or anything you want
            dataserver.Set(memloc, bytes(b'0' * 16))

        #### Test phase
        check_bytes = user.download_file("file")
        #assert(file_bytes == check_bytes)
